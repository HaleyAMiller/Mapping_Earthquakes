# Mapping Earthquakes

Scientists are seeking to visualize trends with earthquakes and tectonic plates and have requested assistance. By using data available about earthquakes and tectonic plates from GeoJSON files, earthquake and tectonic plate data can be synthesized into one map. Along with JavaScript and Leaflet, an interactive map was created which highlights earthquakes by location and magnitude as well as the tectonic plates. Together, the aspects of the map can show scientists the similarities between earthquakes and tectonic plates in a versatile format.
